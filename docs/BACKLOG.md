# Backlog

## In Progress

## Todo

- [] Update the documentation to specify which config files belong to which tools
- [] Update ESLint config to also lint test files in `__tests__` folder.
  Also, need to move flags in ESLint's `npm` scripts related to the config file.
  We need a single source of truth.
- [] Consider changing `"module"` option in `tsconfig.json` to ES module.
  `"type"` needs to be added to `package.json` as well.

- [] Research about licensing.
- [] Set up debugger for phpstorm
- [] Set up debugger neovim (later)
